# Reddit-RCA-Scraping

This script scrapes the Reddit smart contract for Reddit Collectable Avatars and databases every smart contract it has minted. It then saves the smart contract addresses and respected Tx hash to a cloud db for calling later.

## Purpose of this script
This was written to help build a larger application that will scan scam NFT contracts and compare them to the official RCA contracts.
